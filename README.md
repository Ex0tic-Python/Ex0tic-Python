# üêçWelcome to my Github!üêç

Hey, welcome to my Github   
My name's Anibal, aka *Ex0tic-Python*  
I'm a young programmer who programs in mostly Python and C++ while also dabbling in other languages such as Rust, C++, Javascript, Lua, HTML and CSS, and a few other langs.  
I just write code because it's fun and who knows, maybe I could get a career in programming someday.
Here are some of my Github stats that show my top programming languages and other stats:

While it might not seem like I'm coding, I code all the time, just tend to not push my projects or changes often, which is why I have so little commits and what not a month.
